1. Open the python script and edit the path to the input image to be checked(Day/Night)
2. You can use the same script with a series of images in a folder if you use os(package) and run a for-loop to detech the same.
3. Run the Python script Galaxy_project.py in the terminal or in any IDE and you will be able to see the output if image, i.e Day/Night.
4. Thanks...
